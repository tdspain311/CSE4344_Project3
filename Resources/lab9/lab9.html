<h4>Introduction and preliminaries</h4>

This lab uses NetSim, a simple packet-level network simulator.  You
will write the code for the main components of distance-vector and
link-state routing protocols.  

NetSim executes a set of steps every time slot; time increments by 1
each slot.  During each time slot a link can deliver one packet from
source of the link to the destination of the link.

<p>You can run the python programs for this lab using ipython or
  python (ipython602 and python602 on the athena machines).  The lab
  will not work in IDLE.

<p>To understand the different parameters one can set in NetSim, go to a
shell and enter:

<p><tt># python lab8_dv.py -h</tt>

<p>
(Or, in ipython, run <tt>lab8_dv.py -h</tt>)

<p>
This command prints out the various options:

<p>
<tt>
  -n NUMNODES, --numnodes=NUMNODES<br>
  -t SIMTIME, --simtime=SIMTIME<br>
  -r, --rand
</tt>

<p>The "-r" option generates a random topology with the specified
  number of nodes (the default number of nodes is 12 and the default
  simulation time is 2000 time slots).

<p>
This lab has two main tasks, each with a few sub-tasks.  The first
task is to implement a distance-vector (DV) routing protocol.  The
second task is to implement a link-state (LS) routing protocol.  You
will test these implementations on a few different topologies that
will be generated when you run the corresponding task files.

Both routing protocols should construct the <b>minimum cost path</b>
from the Router to all the other destination addresses that are
currently reachable in the network.  The "destination" itself is
derived from the Router class and has an "address" field that will be
used as an index into the routing table and the cost table.  Unless
explicitly mentioned otherwise, we will use the term "minimum-cost
path" and "shortest path" interchangeably,

<p>
<b>Useful classes and data structures</b>

<ul>
<b>The Router class:</b> The logic for DV resides in the DVRouter class,
while the logic for LS is in the LSRouter class.  Both these classes
are derived from the Router class.  The main goal of your software is
to construct and maintain two key pieces of information in the
DVRouter and LSRouter classes: the routing table and the cost of the
minimum-cost path from the Router to the other destination addresses.

<ul>

<li><tt>self.routes</tt>, the routing table: A dictionary that maps from a
  destination address to a link.  This link is the link that the
  Router will use to forward any packet destined for the corresponding
  destination address.

<li><tt>self.spcost</tt>, the table of costs of the shortest (i.e., minimum
  cost) paths: A dictionary that maps from a destination address to
  the current estimate of the cost of the path to get there.

</ul>

<p>
<b>The Link class:</b> This class is defined in lab9_net.py; you don't
need to modify this class, and the main fact you should know for this
lab is that you can obtain the cost of a link, l, using l.cost (a
variable in class Link).  The other place you'll use the Link class is
to populate the routing table, which (by definition) stores the Link
to be used to reach any destination.  We have provided a useful
function in the Router class, <tt>getlink(n)</tt>, which takes a
neighboring Router, <tt>n</tt>, and returns the Link
connecting <tt>self</tt> to <tt>n</tt>.  This function is useful in
constructing the routing table.

</ul>

<p>
<b>The HELLO protocol and maintaining live neighbors</b>

<p>The HELLO protocol has already been implemented for you in
  lab9_router.py (you should not need to modify this file); each
  Router sends a <tt>HELLO</tt> packet every <tt>HELLO_INTERVAL</tt>
  time slots (10 by default in NetSim).  Whenever a node hears
  a <tt>HELLO</tt> along a link, it adds the current time, the address
  of the Router at the other end of the link, and the cost of that
  link, to <tt>self.neighbors</tt>, which is a dictionary mapping a
  Link to a (<tt>timestamp, address, linkcost</tt>) tuple.

<p> If a node does not hear a <tt>HELLO</tt> for more
  than <tt>2*HELLO_INTERVAL</tt> time slots on a link, it removes that
  node from <tt>self.neighbors</tt> and calls the
  Router's <tt>link_failed(link)</tt> function, giving the "failed"
  link as argument.  In response, the routing protocol <i>may</i> take
  suitable actions.

<hr>

<h4>Debugging and Testing Procedures</h4>

Writing distributed protocols, even in simulation, can be a challenge.
To help you a bit, we have some utilities that are accessible via the
GUI.  Clicking on any node while the simulation is running enables you
to look at its routes and shortest path costs to every destination.
For link-state routing, clicking on a node also prints out the last
LSA information available at that node from each of the other nodes.

<p>For simple topologies, eye-balling these routes and the printed
state at several nodes in the network should convince you of the
health of your routing protocol implementation. 

<p>Please note that clicking on any link toggles the state of the link
between "working" and "failed" states, thereby letting you test your
protocol under link failures.  We will want to ensure that your
  protocol works properly in the face of failures and recoveries.

<p>The "Step 1", "Step 10", and "Step 100" buttons are the way in
  which you should step through the operation of your protocol and see
  what is happening by clicking on various nodes.  (The GUI also
  provides a "play" and "step all" buttons, which aren't particularly
  useful for debugging.)

<p>In any given time-slot, colored squares may appear on a link.
  These are packets.  The packets are color-coded: green ones are
  HELLO packets, red are advertisements (type ADVERT), and blue are
  data packets.  (The data packets aren't relevant to this lab.)

<p>For both the routing protocols you will implement in this lab, you
should demonstrate the correctness of the routing tables at the
various nodes in the following scenarios (on any random topology)
during the checkoff interview.

<ul>

<li><b>No link failures</b>. You must verify that
all routes computed at the various nodes actually correspond to the
shortest paths in the graph. In addition, every node must have a
routing table entry for all other nodes in the topology.

<li><b>One or more link failures, but a connected network</b>. The
routing protocol should be able to adjust its routes to route packets
"around" the failed link. You should be able to give a rough estimate
of how long link state and distance vector protocols take to find the
new routes. You should also try bringing the failed link back up and
verify that the routes go back to what they looked like in the base
case.

<li><b>Disconnected topology</b>.  Break enough links in the topology
such that some subset of the nodes cannot reach the other subset. You
must show that your routing protocol eventually converges to the
correct routing in this case -- that is, a node must have a routing
table entry to every node it is connected to by a path in the
underlying topology, and must not have a routing table entry for any
node it cannot reach.  You should also be able to provide a rough
estimate of how long this convergence process lasts for the two
routing protocols. In the case of distance vector routing, you should
also be able to demonstrate the "count to infinity" problem during
convergence.  Finally, when you "heal" one or more links to produce a
connected toplogy, the protocol should eventually ensure that all
nodes find the correct routes to all destinations.

</ul>

Each task below is worth 5 points; in each case, 2 points each for the
first two scenarios mentioned above (no failures and one or more
failures), and 1 point for the third case (disconnection).

<h4>Task #1: Distance vector (DV) routing (5 points)</h4>

The file you will have to extend is <b><tt>lab9_dv.py</tt></b>.  This
file contains the <tt>DVRouter</tt> class, which is derived from
the <tt>Router</tt> class (which in turn derives from
the <tt>Node</tt> class defined in <tt>lab9_net.py</tt>.  Your first
task for this lab is to write the following <u>three</u> functions,
which are the core of any DV protocol:
<ol>

<li><b><tt>make_dv_advertisement()</tt>:</b> Scan
  the <tt>self.routes</tt> and <tt>self.spcost</tt> tables and
  construct a list of <tt>[(dest1, cost1), (dest2, cost2) ...]</tt>.  Return
  this list.

<p>As explained in lecture and the lecture notes, each router in a DV
protocol periodically exchanges <b>routing advertisements</b> with its
neighbors in the network topology, containing the information about
destinations and their shortest-path costs (<tt>[(dest1,cost1), (dest2,cost2),
 ...]</tt>).  This function will be called
every <tt>ADVERT_INTERVAL</tt> time slots (50 by default in NetSim) by
<tt>send_advertisement()</tt>, which will take care of constructing
packets with this list as its contents, and sending one such packet to
each neighbor in the topology.

<li><b><tt>link_failed(link)</tt>:</b> Called when the HELLO protocol
determines a failure.  When called, your code needs to take suitable
action to recognize that the link is now "dead".  For example,
depending on how you design your DV protocol, you may: set self.spcost
for all destinations whose routing table entries currently use that
link to infinity, delete that route from your table, or anything else.

<p>We are intentionally not specifying the precise behavior, leaving
it to you to design it.  As long as what you do in this step is
consistent with what you do in <tt>make_dv_advertisement()</tt>, your
protocol will work correctly.  Conversely, an inconsistency will
likely cause the protocol to be incorrect.

<li><b><tt>integrate(fromnode, adv)</tt>:</b> This function is where
  the actual distributed computation occurs.  It takes as input two
  arguments: the node from which the advertisement came
  (<tt>fromnode</tt>), and the advertisement itself (adv), which you
  constructed as a list in make_dv_advertisement.  (You can ignore the
  marshalling of the advertisement into a packet and the corresponding
  unmarshalling back to the list, but if you're curious, you can see
  how send_advertisement() and process_advertisement() do these
  tasks.)

<p>The result of <tt>integrate()</tt> is the
  current <tt>self.routes</tt> and <tt>self.spcost</tt> tables, which
  as mentioned before, are the routing table and table of shortest
  path costs.  The underlying rule you should use is the Bellman-Ford
  update rule, as described in lecture.

<p>Depending on how you design your DV protocol, you may have to take
  care of one subtle (but important) issue in <tt>integrate()</tt>: if
  you find that a previous advertisement that came
  from <tt>fromnode</tt> contained a destination, and you are using
  the corresponding link as the route to the destination, and the
  current advertisement <b>does not</b> mention the destination, then
  you have to assume that the destination is <b>no longer reachable
  via <tt>fromnode</tt></b>.  Otherwise, it is likely that your
  protocol may not be correct.  You should also note that not every
  design requires this check; it all boils down to how you send your
  routing advertisements.

</ol>

<hr>

<h4>Task #2: Link-state (LS) routing (5 points)</h4>

The LS protocol uses the <tt>LSRouter</tt> class, which is derived
from the
<tt>Router</tt> class.  The <tt>self.routes</tt>
and <tt>self.spcost</tt> tables are identical to the DV case.
The <tt>LSRouter</tt> class adds two new variables to Router:

<ul>
<li><tt>self.LSA</tt>, a dictionary that maps a Router address to a
  list <tt>[seqnum, (n1,c1), (n2,c2) (n3,c3), ...]</tt>, where the Router
  address is the <b>originator</b> of the link-state advertisement
  (LSA), <tt>seqnum</tt> is the current sequence number of the LSA
  from that node, and the <tt>(n_i,c_i)</tt> tuples are the currently
  live neighbor address and link cost from the LSRouter sending the
  LSA.  Note that this LSA does not have a "origin_address" field; we
  simply get that from the source field in the packet, and you don't
  need to worry about it (in practice, implementations will explicitly
  include such a field in the LSA).

<p><tt>self.LSA.get(u)</tt> returns the last LSA update originating
  from Router <tt>u</tt> that this Router (<tt>self</tt>) knows about.
  It has the format <tt>[seqnum, (n1,c1), (n2,c2), ...]</tt> where
  <tt>seqnum</tt> is the sequence number at <tt>u</tt> when it originated the LSA
  and each <tt>n_i</tt> is a neighbor of <tt>u</tt>
  (that <tt>u</tt>'s <tt>HELLO</tt> protocol considered to be "live"
  when it generated the LSA numbered <tt>seqnum</tt>), and <tt>c_i</tt> is the cost of the
  link from <tt>u</tt> to <tt>n_i</tt>.

<li><tt>self.LSA_seqnum</tt>, which is the sequence number for the LSA
  generated by the Router.  It increments by 1 on each successive
  advertisement.

</ul>

<p>The details of how an LS protocol works were described in the
lecture and are in the lecture notes.  Each Router periodically sends
its currenly live links (which we maintain in
the <tt>self.neighbors</tt> dictionary, as explained earlier when we
discussed the HELLO protocol).  Each Router also <b>re-broadcasts</b>,
along all its links, an LSA packet that it receives via a neighboring
Router, containing an LSA originating at some other Router.  This
re-broadcast is done only once per LSA; to ensure this property, the
Router checks the sequence number of the incoming LSA to make sure
that it is larger than the last LSA heard from that originating
Router.  These periodic LSA broadcasts are done
every <tt>ADVERT_INTERVAL</tt> time slots (50 by default in NetSim); the
re-broadcasts are done when a Router receives a new LSA (using the
sequence number check).

<p>
For this task, the file you will have to extend
is <b><tt>lab9_ls.py</tt></b> -- your task is to write the following
<u>two</u> functions, which are the core of any LS protocol:
<ol>

<li><b><tt>make_ls_advertisement()</tt>:</b> consult the list of neighbors,
<tt>self.neighbors</tt>, that are currently "live" and return a list
of <tt>[(neighbor1,linkcost1), (neighbor2,linkcost2), (neighbor3,linkcost3),
...]</tt>.  This function is called by <tt>send_lsa</tt>, which
marshalls this LSA into the packets, and then sends one packet each
along each link.

<p>Note that the <tt>self.neighbors</tt> dictionary mapping
a <tt>Link</tt> to a (<tt>timestamp, address, linkcost</tt>) tuple
will be useful in constructing the LSA; as mentioned above in the
discussion of the <tt>HELLO</tt> protocol, <tt>neighbors</tt> keeps track of currently
"live" neighboring Routers.

<li><b><tt>run_dijkstra(nodes)</tt>:</b> Use Dijkstra's algorithm to
produce <tt>self.routes[dest]</tt> for all <tt>dest</tt>
in <tt>nodes</tt>, as well as <tt>self.spcost[dest]</tt>.  The
topology information for the network (graph) is available in
the <tt>self.LSA</tt>, whose format was described above.  The set of
<tt>nodes</tt> currently reachable from the Router is passed as the
argument to <tt>run_dijkstra()</tt>.

<p>There is one important issue that you need to watch out for in the
  steps of <tt>run_dijkstra()</tt> that will set the routing table
  entries, <tt>self.routes</tt>, for various destinations.  At the
  Router, as you go through the different destinations in
  non-decreasing order of shortest-path costs and set the route to a
  node to be that of its parent in the shortest path tree.  If the
  parent is <tt>self.address</tt> (i.e., the Router running the
  algorithm), then you should remember to set the route to the link
  connecting the Router (<tt>self</tt>) to the destination.  You can
  use the <tt>self.getlink()</tt> method for this purpose.

</li>
